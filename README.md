Lab 2 for Advanced Digital Design class

Implement a MIPS processor (CPU). The main component of any CPU is the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). This is where all the arithmetic, logic, and relational operations happen. In this Lab, we will be designing and implementing a 32-bit ALU.

Note: You can either create the top level ALU using structural-architecture VHDL code, or IP package each unit then use a block diagram to connect them together. 
Either way is fine, but I would recommend the first one. Write a VHDL testbench to verify the functionality of the ALU. You should at least test each ALU operation
once Synthesize, Implement and Generate Bitstream for your ALU, then write C/C++ testbench to fully verify the functionality of your FPGA-configured design. 
You should at least test each ALU operation once. You will be needing more regmap registers for this Lab, so make sure to configure and take notes of their numbers 
and bit-width.
